# Green Stock Analysis

### Project Overview

Steve has asked me to analyze a green stock for his parents to see if they should invest in it.  To do this, I used VBA in Excel to find the stocks total daily volume and the annual return. In the data provided there were additional stocks to compare with to see how the stock performed.  This comparison provided the best option on which stock to invest in.

### Purpose 

The purpose of this project was to find and use an efficent way of reviewing data from multiple stocks in VBA.  The initial code ran and produced the correct data.  However, there was a way to revise (refactor) the code to have it run in less time and become more efficient.  Although this project used 12 stocks refactoring code can be helpful with larger sets of data that can take more time to process.
